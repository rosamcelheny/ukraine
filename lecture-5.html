                    <div>As the war in Ukraine continues, Russia faces sanctions imposed by international governments and organizations intended to disempower the Russian war machine by stopping the flow of money to Russian coffers and pressuring elites to exercise political influence. But sanctions are only effective to the extent they cannot be bypassed. With an estimated $50 billion in annual transaction volume and a global value of $1.7 trillion, art represents a massive asset class, yet the market for art remains largely unregulated and is characterized by opaque transactions. While new opportunities for circumventing sanctions may have recently emerged through crypto-based markets for NFTs, it has long been possible to warehouse valuable art objects in special tax havens, effectively off-shoring these physical assets. What can be done today to close this crucial loophole?</div>
