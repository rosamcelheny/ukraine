                    <div>The fourth edition of The Humanity Dialogues includes the participation of artists, researchers, and curators from Ukraine, Poland and Belarus—Olga Kopenkina, Yulia Krivich, Kuba Szreder, and Asia Tsisar who will share the modes of agency and action that have emerged across artist networks in Central-Eastern Europe as a response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Amid the military struggle for democratic self-determination and an escalating humanitarian crisis, not witnessed in Europe since the second World War, what does this international solidarity of artists and cultural workers entail? What kind of organizational formats do these initiatives assume? How are existing models of artistic interdependency altered, ruptured, or reinforced in the face of military aggression, war crimes, and the displacement of over two million people? How do the roles of existing cultural or art institutions change in the context of war and the dissolution of an open and tolerant civil society? </div>
                    <div>The speakers will discuss these and other topics, referring to the emergent artistic practices, such as activities of the Sunflower House of Culture (a bottom-up initiative affiliated with the Museum of Modern Art in Warsaw) that provides direct aid to Ukrainian refugees, an international bureau devoted to raising the awareness of the decolonial history of the region, and artist initiatives working within the opposition in Belarus—in an effort to reevaluate and to rethink the role of art and artists in the time of war.</div>
