                    <div>Russia’s assault on one of Europe’s largest nuclear power plants in Zaporizhzhia followed the invasion of Ukraine and the occupation of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant one week earlier. Russia made explicit with these actions that it was willing to stand in violation of international humanitarian law to achieve the goals of the state. What has become clear is that this pursuit of conventional warfare risks nuclear catastrophe. The third edition of The Humanity Dialogues includes Kate Brown, the author of Manual for Survival: A Chernobyl Guide to the Future, and Svitlana Matviyenko, an educator and critical media analyst based in Ukraine, in a conversation that addresses the Soviet Union’s response to the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster and the threats posed by the Russian military assaults on operational power plants throughout Ukraine. Filmmaker Oleksiy Radynski will discuss his research on the wider implications of Russia’s actions in what he refers to as the weaponization of the energy sector.
