To fix:
- redesign about button. see figma. 
- on mobile, gif doesn't fill the screen. shoudl go to the bottom.
- on mobile, remove "Talk". Should just show the number
- on mobile, the calendar is too tall; shouldn't overflow the screen.
- center the about button. should stay square.
- do favicon
- im actually ok with not putting a border in the Title part / day part but can we add padding? not sure where to move that 
- favicon
- on the lecture page, menu shoudl go all the way to the top. header should be flush with the text in the description.
- whole header bar should link back to hp.
