To fix:
- redesign about button. see figma. 
- on mobile, the calendar is too tall; shouldn't overflow the screen... this is tricky, since on safari the url bar takes up some space at the bottom...
- center the about button. should stay square.
- favicon
- on the lecture page, menu should go all the way to the top. header should be flush with the text in the description.
