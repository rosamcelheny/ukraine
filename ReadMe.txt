To fix:
- can we transform the About button into a white square button that is flush to the grid of the site/ same position? 
-gif background dissapeared ( i dont hate the site without what do you think)
- im actually ok with not putting a border in the Title part / day part but can we add padding? not sure where to move that 
- favicon
