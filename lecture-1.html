                    <div>In the face of tragedy, there comes a time when any semblance of future is deemed impotent. Stripped of the ability to calibrate or anticipate cause and effect, we face ourselves naked, humble, and without pretense. In the void of any ability to configure, to draft, to fathom, we reflect on human integrity, individuality, collective responsibility, and their preservation amid the dissolution of the tenets of a civilized way of life.</div>
<div>In response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, The Humanity Dialogues is a series of events that reflect on contingency as existence and address art and politics critically intertwined within societies at war. This serves as the first in the series that will continue in the days and weeks ahead.</div>
